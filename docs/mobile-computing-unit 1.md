### Breakdown of the Three-Tier Architecture

- **Tier-1: Presentation Layer (User Interface)**

  - Where users interact with the mobile app.
  - Handles buttons, menus, forms, and screens.
  - Supports multiple users simultaneously.

- **Connection Layer (Access Network)**

  - Routes traffic between user devices and the backend system.
  - Adapts to different devices and network conditions.
  - Ensures efficient data transmission even if one route fails.

- **Tier-2: Application Layer**

  - Process Management – Organizes tasks and workflows (e.g., food ordering steps).
  - Business Logic – Enforces rules and decision-making (e.g., price calculations, discounts).

- **Tier-3: Data Layer**

  - Database Management – Organizes data storage and retrieval (like a librarian).
  - Data Store – The actual storage where information is kept (like a bookshelf).

---

### Why This Design?

- Scalability: More users can be handled by expanding any layer.
- Reliability: If one component fails, others continue functioning.
- Flexibility: Different layers can be updated or fixed independently.
- Adaptability: Works well on various devices and network conditions.

| Layer | Restaurant Example |
| --- | --- |
| Presentation Tier | The dining area where customers interact with waiters. |
| Access Network | The waiters who take orders to the kitchen. |
| Application Tier | The kitchen where food is prepared based on orders. |
| Data Tier | The pantry where ingredients are stored. |
