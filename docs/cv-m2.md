# Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)

SIFT is an algorithm used to detect distinct key points or features in an image.  
These key points are **robust to changes** in **scale, rotation, and affine transformations**, making SIFT widely used in object recognition, image stitching, and 3D reconstruction.

## Advantages of SIFT Detector

!!! note  
    SIFT provides a **highly distinctive** feature descriptor, making it useful for matching objects in large databases.

| **Advantage**      | **Description**  |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| **Locality**      | Features are local and robust to **occlusion**. Does not require **segmentation** of objects. |
| **Distinctiveness** | Features can be **matched** to a **large database** of objects. |
| **Quantity**      | Generates **many features**, even for small objects. |
| **Efficiency**    | Close to **real-time performance**. |
| **Extensibility** | Easily extends to **various feature types**. |

## Integral Image

An **integral image** is a technique that allows for the **fast computation** of the sum of pixel values over a rectangular region.

### **Key Properties**
- **Speeds up** sum calculations for **box-type filters**.
- **Reduces computational cost** for large-scale image processing.

### **Mathematical Representation**
For an input image \( I(x,y) \), the integral image \( I_{Int}(x,y) \) at a location \( (x,y) \) is computed as:

\[
I_{Int}(x, y) = \sum_{i=0}^{x} \sum_{j=0}^{y} I(i, j)
\]

### **Use of Integral Image**
The sum of all pixel values in a region can be quickly computed using four values:

\[
S = A - B - C + D
\]

where:
- \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \) are elements of the **integral image** at the corners of the selected region.

!!! note 
    Even if size of filter increases, number of computations (3 additions/subtractions) does not increase

### **Comparison of SIFT and SURF**  

| Feature            | **SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)** | **SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features)** |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Dimensionality** | High-dimensional feature descriptor       | Lower dimensional, more compact descriptor |
| **Accuracy**      | Reduction in dimensionality decreases accuracy | More efficient without significant accuracy loss |
| **Keypoint Detection** | Approximates **Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)** using **Difference of Gaussian (DoG)** | Approximates **LoG** using **Box Filters** |
| **Computation**   | Uses **determinant and trace** of the Hessian matrix | Uses **only determinant** of Hessian matrix |
| **Speed**        | Computationally expensive | Faster due to **integral images and parallel convolution** |
| **Real-Time Applications** | Not optimized for real-time processing | Suitable for **real-time tracking & object recognition** |

!!! tip  
    **SURF is a faster alternative to SIFT, making it suitable for real-time applications while maintaining robustness.**

Here's a well-structured and visually appealing representation of the **Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) Algorithm**, formatted for MkDocs. It includes a **mermaid flowchart** for clarity.

## **Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) Algorithm**  

## **1. Detector**  
1. **Construct Hessian matrix** using box filters at each pixel to determine keypoints.  
2. **Increase the size of box filters** and repeat step 1.  
3. For each keypoint, **select points** within a radius of **6σ** (where **σ** is the standard deviation of the keypoint's filter).  
4. **Apply a Gaussian filter** of **2.5σ** on the keypoint.  
5. Use a **Haar wavelet of size 4σ** to determine the **magnitude** and **direction** of points.  
6. Draw a **histogram with 6 bins** to identify the **orientation** of the keypoint.  

## **2. Descriptor**  
1. Around each keypoint, **select a square region** of size **(20σ × 20σ)**.  
2. **Divide the region** into **16 sub-regions**.  
3. For each sub-region, **determine a vector** of length **4**.  
4. The **final descriptor vector** has a total length of **64**.

!!! tip  
    **SURF is significantly faster than SIFT** due to its use of **box filters and integral images**, making it suitable for **real-time applications**.
