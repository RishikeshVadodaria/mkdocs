### Questions of Curiosity

#### 1. Factors Affecting Call Blocking Probability
Call blocking probability (CBP) depends on network load, resource availability, user density, traffic patterns, call setup efficiency, and handover management. High congestion, inadequate spectrum, and poor mobility handling increase CBP, especially in urban areas.

#### 2. Impact of Network Slicing on CBP
Network slicing optimizes resource allocation by creating virtual networks for different use cases. It ensures priority for critical services, enhances QoS, and isolates traffic, reducing congestion and minimizing call blocking.

#### 3. Industry Benchmarks for Call Blocking
Industry standards, such as ITU and 3GPP, recommend CBP levels below 2% for quality service, with 4G networks aiming for ~1%. Newer technologies like 5G set even lower targets to ensure high reliability and low latency.

#### 4. Geographical Influence on CBP
Urban areas experience high CBP due to user density, while rural areas suffer from inadequate infrastructure. Factors like peak-hour traffic, signal obstructions, and sparse cell coverage also impact call blocking rates.

#### 5. Strategies to Reduce CBP
Minimization strategies include:
- **Cell Load Balancing:** Redistributes traffic to avoid congestion.
- **Advanced Technologies:** Carrier aggregation, MIMO, and small cells improve spectrum efficiency.
- **Alternative Networks:** Wi-Fi/5G offloading reduces macro network strain.
- **AI-Driven Optimization:** Predictive resource management mitigates congestion proactively.

#### 6. Hidden Node Problem and Avoidance Strategies

##### What are the ways in which hidden node problems are avoided?
- **RTS/CTS Mechanism:** The Request To Send/Clear To Send (RTS/CTS) protocol helps prevent collisions by coordinating node transmissions.
- **Increasing Transmission Power:** Extending node communication range can reduce hidden node occurrences.
- **Using Omnidirectional Antennas:** Ensures better connectivity among nodes.
- **Node Relocation:** Physically repositioning nodes enhances communication.
- **Protocol Enhancements:** Polling and token-passing strategies improve medium access management.

##### What is the exposed node problem? How can you avoid this?
- **Definition:** The exposed node problem occurs when a node refrains from sending packets due to perceived interference, even when transmission is possible.
- **Avoidance Strategies:**
  - **Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA):** Helps avoid unnecessary transmission blocking.
  - **RTS/CTS Mechanism:** Coordinates transmissions to minimize interference.

##### How does the hidden node problem impact different types of network traffic?
- **Real-time Video Traffic:** Sensitive to delays and packet loss, leading to degraded quality.
- **File Transfer Traffic:** Collisions cause retransmissions, slowing down transfer rates.

##### What role does transmission power control play in mitigating hidden node problems?
- Adjusting power levels helps nodes detect each other, reducing hidden node occurrences while managing interference.

##### How do different wireless standards (802.11a/b/g/n/ac) handle the hidden node problem differently?

| Standard  | Handling Method |
|-----------|----------------|
| 802.11a   | Uses RTS/CTS; limited effectiveness due to shorter range. |
| 802.11b   | RTS/CTS implementation; better range but still vulnerable. |
| 802.11g   | RTS/CTS support with backward compatibility; performance varies. |
| 802.11n   | MIMO technology enhances range and mitigates hidden node issues. |
| 802.11ac  | Beamforming and MIMO optimize signal paths, reducing problems. |


#### 1. If we modified the simulation to include bidirectional traffic (where wireless nodes communicate with each other instead of just with Node 1), how would this affect network congestion and overall performance? Propose a test setup to compare unidirectional vs bidirectional communication patterns with the same number of nodes.
**Effect:** Bidirectional traffic would increase network congestion due to the added communication paths between nodes, leading to higher contention for bandwidth. It could also introduce delays due to more frequent collisions or retransmissions.

**Test Setup:** Compare unidirectional vs. bidirectional traffic with the same number of nodes, measuring throughput, delay, and packet loss for both configurations. Use the same traffic load and node density in both setups to ensure a fair comparison.

#### 2. How would implementing different packet sizes in the application properties affect network performance across the varying number of nodes? Design a test scenario to compare the impact of small (256 bytes) versus large (1500 bytes) packet sizes on throughput and delay.

**Effect:** Larger packet sizes (1500 bytes) would typically result in higher throughput but could cause longer delays due to increased transmission time. Smaller packets (256 bytes) result in lower throughput but might offer better responsiveness with reduced latency.

**Test Scenario:** Set up two scenarios with varying packet sizes: one with 256-byte packets and the other with 1500-byte packets. Measure throughput and delay while increasing the number of nodes to observe the impact of packet size on network performance.

#### 3. What impact would environmental factors (like walls, interference from other devices, or distance between nodes) have on the network performance if we had enabled path loss in the wireless link properties? How does this relate to real-world implementations?

**Effect:** Environmental factors like walls, interference, or distance can significantly affect signal strength, leading to higher packet loss and reduced throughput. Path loss models simulate this by weakening the signal based on distance and obstacles.

**Real-world Relation:** This mimics real-world wireless networks, where physical obstructions and interference reduce communication quality and range, thus affecting performance (e.g., in offices, homes, or urban areas).

#### 4. Why was TCP disabled in the transport layer for this experiment? How would the results differ if TCP was enabled, and what additional network characteristics would we be able to observe?

**Reason for Disablement:** TCP was likely disabled to focus on the raw performance of the network layer without the influence of transport layer reliability (e.g., retransmissions, congestion control).

**Effect of Enabling TCP:** If TCP were enabled, we would see added overhead due to retransmissions and flow control, possibly lowering throughput but improving reliability and reducing packet loss. We could also observe network congestion more clearly.

#### 5. If we enable path loss in wireless link properties, how would it affect the number of successful transmissions?

**Impact:** Path loss would result in fewer successful transmissions as the signal strength diminishes with distance and obstacles. This would likely increase packet loss and require more retransmissions, reducing overall network efficiency.
