# Unit 4: IPv6

## Understanding IPv4

An **IP address (Internet Protocol address)** is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network using the Internet Protocol. It serves two main purposes:

- **Identification**: Uniquely identifies a device on a network.
- **Location Addressing**: Indicates where a device is located within a network, enabling data routing.

!!! note
    IP addresses are essential for devices to communicate over the internet, ensuring proper identification and data transmission.

---

## IPv4 Format

IPv4 (**Internet Protocol Version 4**) is the most widely used system for identifying devices on a network. It uses a **32-bit addressing scheme**, represented as four numbers separated by periods.

### Example:

```plaintext
192.168.0.1
```

Each number (octet) can range from **0 to 255**.

!!! tip
    IPv4 supports approximately **4.3 billion** unique addresses, which is why IPv6 was introduced to handle the growing number of devices.

---

## Mobile IPv4

Mobile IPv4 is a protocol that enables devices to **maintain their IP address and network connectivity** while moving between different networks.

### Key Benefits:

- Ensures continuous network connections when a device changes its network (e.g., switching from Wi-Fi to cellular data).
- Maintains seamless communication for mobile users.

!!! warning
    Without Mobile IPv4, devices would lose their network sessions when changing networks, leading to dropped connections and data loss.

## Agent Advertisement

Agent Advertisement is a process where **Home Agents (HA) and Foreign Agents (FA)** periodically send advertisement messages into their physical subnets.

### How It Works:

- **HA/FA broadcast advertisement messages** (ICMP messages) into the subnet.
- These messages act as beacons to notify Mobile Nodes (MN) of available networks.
- **Packet Details:**
  - **TTL (Time To Live):** Set to `1` to prevent forwarding.
  - **Destination Address:**
    - `224.0.0.1` (Multicast Address) or
    - `255.255.255.255` (Broadcast Address)
- **Mobile Node (MN) Actions:**
  - Listens for advertisement messages.
  - Detects if it's in a home or foreign network.
  - Reads a **Care-of Address (COA)** from FA advertisement messages.

| Field               | Value                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| TTL                 | 1 (Prevents forwarding)       |
| Destination Address | `224.0.0.1` (Multicast)       |
| Destination Address | `255.255.255.255` (Broadcast) |

!!! note
    The **Care-of Address (COA)** allows the mobile device to register its new location while roaming, ensuring uninterrupted communication.

## Mobile IP: Basic Operation

### Agent Solicitation

If no agent advertisements are present, or if the time between two advertisements is too high, the mobile node must send an **Agent Solicitation** message.

- The solicitation message **should not flood the network**.
- A mobile node can send up to **three solicitations per second** upon entering a foreign network.
- If no response is received, the solicitation rate **decreases exponentially** to avoid network congestion.
- **Agent discovery** allows the mobile node to establish a better connection.
- Once an agent is discovered, the mobile node obtains a **Care-of Address (COA)**.

---

## Registration Request

Registration requests use **UDP packets** with the following structure:

- **Source Address**: Mobile Node (MN) IP address.
- **Destination Address**: Home Agent (HA) or Foreign Agent (FA) IP address (depending on COA location).
- **Type Field**: Set to `1` to indicate a registration request.
- **Flags:**
  - `S` – Request Home Agent to retain previous mobility binding.
  - `B` – Request to receive broadcast packets from the home network.
  - `D` – Mobile Node will handle decapsulation at the tunnel (if COA is located at MN).
  - `M/G` – Defines encapsulation type.
  - `T` – Enables reverse tunneling.
- **Lifetime**: Defines the validity of the registration (in seconds).
- **Home Address**: Fixed IP address of the Mobile Node.
- **Home Agent**: IP address of the Home Agent.
- **COA (Care-of Address)**: Represents the tunnel endpoint.
- **Identification**: 64-bit identifier generated by MN to match registration requests and replies, preventing replay attacks.

---

## Registration Reply

Once a registration request is processed, a **registration reply** is sent back using **UDP packets**:

- **Type Field**: Set to `3` to indicate a registration reply.
- **Code Field**: Specifies the result of the registration request.

!!! tip
    Registration replies confirm whether a Mobile Node's registration was successful and provide status codes for troubleshooting.

## Types of Encapsulation

Encapsulation is essential in **Mobile IP** to ensure packets reach the **Care-of Address (COA)**. The **Home Agent (HA)** takes the original packet (with the **Mobile Node (MN)** as the destination), places it inside the data portion of a new packet, and sets a new IP header so that it is correctly routed to the COA. 

The newly added IP header is called the **outer header**.

### **Encapsulation Methods:**
There are three primary types of encapsulation:

1. **IP-in-IP Encapsulation**
2. **Minimal Encapsulation**
3. **Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)**

---

### **1. IP-in-IP Encapsulation**
- **Defined in RFC 2003 (Mandatory)**
- Creates a **tunnel** between the **Home Agent (HA)** and the **COA**.
- The entire original **IP packet** is encapsulated within a new **IP header**.
- Used when the MN is using a **foreign agent COA**.


![alt text](image-2.png)

---

### **2. Minimal Encapsulation**
- Reduces redundancy present in **IP-in-IP encapsulation**.
- Only essential fields from the original header are included.
- Helps in reducing overhead, improving efficiency.

![alt text](image-3.png)


---

### **3. Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)**
- Unlike **IP-in-IP** and **Minimal Encapsulation**, which work only for **IP packets**, **GRE** supports **other network layer protocols**.
- Allows encapsulation of **different protocol suites** into the payload portion of a packet.
- Uses an **outer IP header**, with **TTL and TOS values copied** from the original header.
- Provides flexibility for **non-IP protocols** to be transported over an IP network.

!!! note
GRE is widely used in **VPNs** and **multicast routing** to carry non-IP traffic efficiently over an IP-based network.

## **Mobile IP and IPv6**  

### **Key Features of Mobile IP in IPv6**  
- **Integrated Security**: Unlike IPv4, security is built into IPv6 rather than being an add-on. Authentication for registration is included.  
- **Auto-Configuration of COA**:  
  - IPv6 supports automatic configuration of the **Care-of Address (COA)**.  
  - **DHCPv6** can be used for dynamic COA assignment.  
  - Every IPv6 node has built-in address auto-configuration.  
- **No Need for a Foreign Agent (FA)**:  
  - In IPv6, **all routers** perform **router advertisements**, eliminating the need for a dedicated **Foreign Agent**.  
- **Direct COA Signaling (Route Optimization)**:  
  - The **Mobile Node (MN)** can directly inform a sender of its COA, bypassing the **Home Agent (HA)**.  
  - This enables **automatic path optimization**, reducing latency.  
- **Soft Handovers (Seamless Mobility)**:  
  - IPv6 supports smooth handovers **without packet loss** between subnets.  
  - The MN sends its **new COA** to the old router.  
  - The **old router** encapsulates and forwards packets to the new COA.  
  - Authentication remains intact throughout the process.  

---

## **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**  

### **Overview of DHCP**  
- **DHCP** is a standardized **networking protocol** used by servers to dynamically allocate **IP addresses** to computers in a network.  
- **Primary Purpose**: Automates IP configuration without requiring a network administrator.  

### **How DHCP Works**  
1. **IP Address Allocation**  
   - DHCP assigns IP addresses from a **predefined range** stored in a **server database**.  
   - Each IP is assigned for a **lease period**, after which the device must renew or acquire a new address.  

2. **Full Network Integration**  
   - DHCP provides additional configuration details:  
     - **DNS Server Address**  
     - **Default Gateway (Router)**  
     - **Subnet Mask**  
     - **Domain Name**  
     - **IP Address**  

### **DHCP Client-Server Model**  
- DHCP follows a **client/server model** where clients request IP configurations from servers.  
- Clients send **broadcast requests** using MAC addresses to find available DHCP servers.  
- A **DHCP relay agent** forwards requests if servers are in a different network segment.  

![alt text](image-6.png)
![alt text](image-7.png)

### **DHCP Process**  
1. **Client broadcasts a DHCPDISCOVER** to find available DHCP servers.  
2. **DHCP servers respond with DHCPOFFER**, listing available configurations.  
3. **Client sends a DHCPREQUEST** to accept one configuration and reject others.  
4. **Selected server sends a DHCPACK**, confirming the lease.  
5. **If the client leaves the subnet**, it sends a **DHCPRELEASE** to free the assigned IP.  

### **DHCP in Mobile IP**  
- DHCP is a strong candidate for **Care-of Address (COA) assignment** in Mobile IP.  
- **Security Concern**: Without authentication, neither the **Mobile Node (MN)** nor the **DHCP server** can trust each other.  

---

## **Mobile Transport Layer**  

### **Why Transport Layer Support is Needed for Mobility**  
- Mobile networks introduce challenges beyond just network-layer mobility.  
- The **Transport Layer** plays a critical role in:  
  - **Checksumming** over user data.  
  - **Multiplexing/Demultiplexing** data to and from applications.  

### **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**  
- **Simple addressing mechanism**.  
- **Connectionless** (No established connection).  
- **No reliability guarantees** (No retransmission, no in-order delivery).  

### **UDP vs. TCP in Mobile Networks**  

| Feature | **UDP** | **TCP** |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Connection Type** | Connectionless | Connection-oriented |
| **Reliability** | No reliability | Reliable (retransmissions, acknowledgments) |
| **Congestion Control** | None | Reduces speed in case of network congestion |
| **Order of Delivery** | No guarantee | Ensures in-order delivery |
| **Usage in Mobility** | Suitable for real-time applications | Requires adaptation for mobile networks |

### **Challenges of TCP in Mobile Networks**  
- TCP assumes **packet loss** is due to **network congestion**, reducing the transmission rate unnecessarily.  
- Mobile networks require **optimized TCP** for **3G, 4G, and 5G** environments.  

---

## Traditional TCP and Congestion Control

TCP was originally designed for **fixed networks** with **stable end-systems** where:

- Hardware introduces minimal transmission errors.  
- Packet loss typically occurs due to network congestion.  
- Routers **drop packets** when overloaded.  

### How Does the Sender Detect Packet Loss?
- **Missing Acknowledgements (ACKs).**

#### Incorrect Approach:
Simply retransmitting the missing packet **without adjusting the transmission rate**.

#### Correct Approach:
TCP **slows down** dramatically using congestion control mechanisms.

---

## TCP Slow Start

After detecting congestion, TCP enters **Slow Start** mode:

- The **congestion window** (`cwnd`) begins at **1 segment**.
- For every **successful ACK**, `cwnd` **doubles** (exponential growth).
- Growth continues **until** reaching a **threshold (ssthresh)**.
- After reaching `ssthresh`, TCP switches to **linear increase**.

### Conditions for Stopping Growth:
1. **Time-out due to missing ACK.**  
2. **Multiple ACKs for the same packet (duplicate ACKs).**

### TCP Congestion Control Steps
| Condition                      | Action Taken               |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------|
| First packet drop detected     | Reduce `ssthresh` to half  |
| Restart slow start             | Reset `cwnd` to 1 segment |
| Continue with linear increase  | Until new loss occurs      |

---

## Fast Retransmit and Fast Recovery

### Fast Retransmit:
- If multiple duplicate ACKs are received **before a timeout**, the sender **immediately retransmits** the lost packet.
- Avoids waiting for the retransmission timer.

### Fast Recovery:
- Instead of **resetting to slow start**, TCP **continues with the current congestion window**.
- This prevents **unnecessary performance degradation**.

!!! tip
    Fast retransmit helps avoid unnecessary delays and ensures smoother TCP performance.

---

## Implications of TCP on Mobility

TCP **performs poorly** in **mobile environments** due to incorrect assumptions.

### Incorrect Assumptions:
- **Packet loss = Network congestion** (but mobile networks lose packets due to handovers).
- **Wireless error rates = Wired error rates** (wireless links are more error-prone).

### Mobile IP Issue:
- Packets **in transit** to the old Foreign Agent (FA) are lost when the Mobile Node (MN) **moves**.
- **TCP cannot differentiate** between congestion-based and mobility-based packet losses.

!!! warning
    TCP uses **error control mechanisms** to handle **network congestion**, which is **not ideal** for mobile networks.

---

## TCP Improvements: Indirect TCP (I-TCP)

### How I-TCP Works:
- Keeps **standard TCP** for fixed networks.
- Uses an **optimized TCP** for mobile devices.
- **Splits the TCP connection** at the **Foreign Agent (FA)** into **two separate connections**.

### Process:
1. **Correspondent host** sends a packet.  
2. **Foreign Agent acknowledges** and forwards it to the **Mobile Node**.  
3. Any **packet loss** in the wireless network is handled by the **Foreign Agent**.  
4. If handover occurs, **socket state (sequence numbers, ports, etc.)** is migrated.  

---

## Advantages of I-TCP

- **No changes needed** in existing TCP implementations.  
- Wireless **errors don’t affect fixed networks**.  
- Faster **packet loss recovery** (shorter wireless delays).  
- Allows **different transport protocols** between FA and MN.  

!!! note
    I-TCP enhances TCP performance in wireless environments **without altering** fixed-network implementations.

---

## Disadvantages of I-TCP

- **Loses TCP’s end-to-end reliability** if FA crashes.  
- **Increased handover latency** due to buffering at FA.  
- **Security risks**: FA must be **trusted**, especially for encrypted data.  

!!! warning
    If the **Foreign Agent crashes**, the entire session **might fail**, causing disruptions.

---

## Summary of TCP Enhancements

| Feature            | Standard TCP | Fast Retransmit | I-TCP |
|--------------------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Handles congestion | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Works in mobile networks | No | No | Yes |
| Requires protocol changes | No | No | Yes |
| Improves packet loss recovery | No | Yes | Yes |
| Preserves end-to-end connection | Yes | Yes | No |

!!! tip
    I-TCP is a **powerful improvement** for mobile networks, but it **compromises end-to-end reliability**.

## TCP Improvements

### Snooping TCP

One of the drawbacks of I-TCP is the segmentation of the TCP connection, which **violates end-to-end TCP semantics**. Snooping TCP offers a **transparent extension** of TCP at the **Foreign Agent (FA)** to mitigate this issue.

### How Snooping TCP Works
- **The Foreign Agent (FA) buffers packets** sent to the mobile host (MH) until an **ACK is received**.
- FA **monitors (snoops) the packet flow** in both directions.
- If a packet is lost on the **wireless link**, FA **immediately retransmits it** (local retransmission).
- The FA **filters duplicate ACKs** and prevents unnecessary congestion control actions in the fixed network.

### Data Transfer Mechanism
- **To the Mobile Host**:  
  - FA buffers data until it receives an **ACK from MH**.  
  - If a **duplicate ACK or timeout** occurs, FA quickly retransmits the packet.
- **From the Mobile Host**:  
  - FA detects lost packets via **sequence numbers**.  
  - FA sends a **Negative Acknowledgment (NACK)** to MH for quick retransmission.  

### Integration with MAC Layer
- The **MAC layer** already detects **duplicate packets** due to retransmissions.
- This prevents redundant retransmissions by TCP.

### Advantages of Snooping TCP
- **Preserves end-to-end semantics** (FA does not acknowledge data on behalf of MH).
- **Reduces packet loss impact** on wireless links.
- **No changes required in the fixed network**.

---

## Mobile TCP (M-TCP)

### Why M-TCP?
M-TCP improves **overall TCP performance** in mobile environments by:
- **Maintaining end-to-end TCP semantics**.
- **Reducing delay** in case of handovers.
- **Enhancing throughput** and handling frequent disconnections.

### How M-TCP Works
Like I-TCP, **M-TCP splits the TCP connection**, but with key differences:
- Uses a **Supervisory Host (SH)** instead of a Foreign Agent.
- **SH does not cache or retransmit packets**.
- If **disconnection is detected**, SH **sets sender window size to 0**.
- The sender **goes into persistent mode**, preventing unnecessary retransmissions.
- When **connectivity is restored**, SH **restores the sender window** to its original value.

### Advantages of M-TCP
- **Preserves end-to-end TCP semantics** (SH does not modify ACKs).
- **Handles disconnections efficiently** without slow starts.
- **No buffering at SH**, reducing memory usage.

### Disadvantages of M-TCP
- **Packet loss on wireless links affects the fixed network**.
- **Requires modifications** to both **MH protocol stack** and **network infrastructure**.

---

## Fast Retransmit / Fast Recovery

This approach forces TCP’s **Fast Retransmit** mechanism to **handle handovers efficiently**.

### How It Works
- When the **mobile host (MH) moves to a new Foreign Agent (FA)**, it **immediately sends duplicate ACKs** to the Correspondent Host (CH).
- Sending **three duplicate ACKs** triggers **Fast Retransmit** at CH.
- This prevents **Slow Start**, improving handover performance.

### Advantages
- **Simple to implement**.
- **Faster recovery from handover-related losses**.

### Disadvantages
- Retransmitted packets **still travel through the entire network**.
- If **handover takes too long**, CH **may initiate retransmissions prematurely**.
- This approach **does not address wireless link issues**.

---

## Transmission / Timeout Freezing

TCP performance **degrades in long interruptions** (e.g., tunnels, no coverage areas). **Timeout Freezing** prevents unnecessary retransmissions.

### How It Works
- **The MAC layer detects connection loss early**.
- TCP **pauses timers** and **freezes the congestion window**.
- Once connectivity **is restored**, TCP **resumes from the exact point it was stopped**.

### Advantages
- **Prevents unnecessary retransmissions** during **long disconnections**.
- **Maintains TCP state** without requiring modifications in the fixed network.
- Works **independently of acknowledgments or sequence numbers**.

### Disadvantages
- **Relies on MAC layer** to detect interruptions accurately.
- **Encryption mechanisms with time-dependent keys** may cause issues.

---

## Selective Retransmission

### Why It’s Needed
Standard TCP **cumulatively acknowledges packets**. If a single packet is lost, TCP **retransmits all subsequent packets**, **wasting bandwidth**.

### How Selective Retransmission Works
- The receiver **requests only the lost packets**.
- The sender **sends the missing packets** instead of retransmitting everything.

### Advantages
- **Minimizes retransmission overhead**, especially in wireless networks.
- **Improves efficiency** on low-bandwidth connections.

### Disadvantages
- **Requires additional buffer space** at the receiver.
- **More complex implementation** compared to standard TCP.

---

## Transaction-Oriented TCP

### Problem with Traditional TCP
For **short-lived requests**, such as a **mobile host sending a single request to a server**, TCP’s **connection setup overhead** is too high.

### Issues with Standard TCP for Transactions
- **Three-way handshake** for connection setup.
- **Multiple packets needed** for transmission.
- **Three more packets** for connection teardown.
- If the data fits in **one packet**, TCP still **requires seven packets**.

### Solution: Transaction-Oriented TCP
- Reduces **TCP overhead** for **short transactions**.
- Uses **minimal packet exchanges**.

![alt text](image-8.png)


- T/TCP can combine packets for connection establishment and connection release with user data packets. 
= This can reduce the number of packets down to two instead of seven.
### Advantage for certain applications is the reduction in the overhead which standard TCP has for connection setup and connection release.
- T/TCP is not the original TCP anymore, so it requires changes in the mobile host and all correspondent hosts, which is a major disadvantage. 

---

## **TCP Enhancements for Wireless and Mobile Networks**

## **Introduction**  
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) was originally designed for wired networks, where packet loss is primarily due to congestion. However, in **wireless and mobile networks**, factors such as **high latency, jitter, and packet loss due to handovers or signal interference** significantly degrade TCP performance. This document explores various TCP improvements tailored for wireless environments.

---

## **1. Snooping TCP**  

!!! note  
    **Snooping TCP** is a **transparent extension** of TCP within the **foreign agent (FA)** to optimize performance in mobile networks.

### **How It Works**  
- The **foreign agent (FA)** buffers packets **destined for the mobile host (MH)** until an acknowledgment (ACK) is received.  
- If a **packet is lost** on the wireless link, the FA retransmits it **locally** instead of relying on the original sender.  
- The FA **snoops** acknowledgments and filters duplicate ACKs, reducing unnecessary retransmissions.  

### **Advantages**  
- **Preserves end-to-end TCP semantics** by acknowledging only when the MH responds.  
- **Faster retransmissions** as lost packets are handled locally.  
- **Works transparently** without modifications to the TCP sender.  

### **Limitations**  
- Requires **modifications at the foreign agent**.  
- Does **not work with encrypted TCP headers** (e.g., IPsec).

---

## **2. Mobile TCP (M-TCP)**  

!!! tip  
    M-TCP **improves throughput** while maintaining **end-to-end TCP semantics** and ensuring **efficient handovers**.

### **How It Works**  
- **Supervisory Host (SH)** monitors TCP traffic but **does not cache or retransmit packets**.  
- If the **mobile host disconnects**, the SH sets the **sender’s TCP window size to zero**, preventing unnecessary retransmissions.  
- Once connectivity is restored, the window is **reopened** at the previous value, resuming normal data transfer.  

### **Advantages**  
✅ Supports **long disconnections** without breaking connections.  
✅ **Prevents slow start** by maintaining the sender’s state.  
✅ **No buffering** at the supervisory host, reducing overhead.  

### **Limitations**  
❌ Packet loss on the **wireless link affects the fixed network**.  
❌ Requires **modifications to the mobile host’s TCP stack**.  

---

## **3. Fast Retransmit & Fast Recovery**  

!!! warning  
    This method **artificially triggers** fast retransmission to prevent slow start during handovers.

### **How It Works**  
- When a **mobile host moves to a new foreign agent**, it **sends three duplicate ACKs** to the correspondent host.  
- This **forces the correspondent host into fast retransmit mode** without triggering slow start.  

### **Advantages**  
- **Reduces delay during handovers.**  
- **Simple to implement** with minor modifications.  

### **Limitations**  
- **Inefficient** for networks with **high latency**.  
- If the **handover is slow**, the retransmitted packets may arrive too late.  

```plaintext
Example: Mobile host sends 3 duplicate ACKs -> Fast retransmit triggered
```

---

## **4. Transmission Timeout Freezing**  

!!! note  
    When a **long disconnection** (e.g., moving through a tunnel) is detected, TCP **freezes** its state to prevent timeouts.

### **How It Works**  
- The **MAC layer detects a connection issue** before TCP is interrupted.  
- TCP **pauses** timers and stops retransmissions, maintaining the congestion window state.  
- Once connectivity is restored, TCP resumes **without triggering slow start**.  

### **Advantages**  
✅ Ideal for **long interruptions** (e.g., tunnels, network congestion).  
✅ **Independent of TCP mechanisms** like sequence numbers and acknowledgments.  

### **Limitations**  
❌ **Requires MAC layer awareness** of connection issues.  
❌ Does **not work with encryption** methods that rely on timestamps.  

---

## **5. Selective Retransmission**  

!!! tip  
    Instead of retransmitting **all unacknowledged packets**, TCP resends **only the lost ones** using **Selective Acknowledgment (SACK)**.

### **How It Works**  
- The receiver **informs the sender** exactly **which packets were lost**.  
- The sender **only retransmits** those specific packets.  

### **Advantages**  
✅ **Reduces bandwidth consumption**, especially on wireless links.  
✅ **Speeds up recovery** from packet loss.  

### **Limitations**  
❌ Requires **more complex receiver logic**.  
❌ **Buffering overhead** for out-of-order packets.  

```plaintext
Example: Lost packet #4 detected -> Only #4 is retransmitted
```

---

## **6. TCP Over 2.5G/3G Networks**  

!!! warning  
    TCP performance in **2.5G/3G networks** is affected by **high latency, jitter, and bandwidth fluctuations**.

### **Challenges in 2.5G/3G**  
| **Factor**        | **Impact on TCP**                                | **Mitigation**                        |
|------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Latency**       | Increases **RTT** due to error correction | Use **timestamp option** for better RTT estimation |
| **Jitter**        | Causes **random delay spikes** | Enable **Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)** |
| **Packet Loss**   | Occurs during handovers        | Use **Selective Acknowledgment (SACK)** |
| **Bandwidth Oscillations** | Reduces throughput unpredictably | Use **large windows and limited transmit** |

### **Recommended TCP Optimizations**  
- **Large TCP Window Size** to adapt to higher latency.  
- **Limited Transmit (RFC 3042)** to improve performance for small data transmissions.  
- **Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)** to signal congestion without dropping packets.  
- **Selective Acknowledgment (SACK)** for efficient retransmission.  
- **Avoid TCP Header Compression (RFC 1144)** as it performs poorly with packet loss.  

---

## **7. Performance-Enhancing Proxies (PEP)**  

!!! note  
    **Proxies** are used to improve TCP performance in wireless networks by handling retransmissions locally.

### **How It Works**  
- **Splits the connection** between sender and mobile host.  
- **Optimizes data flow** by caching and retransmitting lost packets **at the proxy level**.  

### **Advantages**  
✅ **Reduces delay** by handling retransmissions locally.  
✅ **Improves throughput** in high-latency wireless networks.  

### **Limitations**  
❌ **Breaks end-to-end TCP semantics**.  
❌ **Not compatible with IPsec encryption**.
